            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
                    <li>1/2 onion</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small bowl, beat egg, and add in 1 tablespoon milk. Stir in panko 
                        breadcrumbs; let stand for 1 minute to soften slightly. Add ground beef.</li>
                    <li>Place onion in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped.</li>
                    <li>Add onion, Parmesan, garlic, salt, and pepper to the bowl of ground beef. 
                        Using clean, gloved hands, combine mixture gently. If mixture feels tough, add 
                        1 tablespoon milk. Shape mixture into 1 1/2-inch meatballs.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Place meatballs in 
                        a single layer, without crowding, into the skillet, and cook, turning and moving 
                        them around every 2 or 3 minutes, until well browned on all sides and no longer 
                        pink at the center, 10 to 14 minutes, adjusting temperature as needed. An 
                        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 
                        degrees F (71 degrees C). You may have to cook meatballs in batches.</li>
                    <li>Remove meatballs to a foil-lined drip tray. Serve with pasta and sauce 
                        if desired.</li>
                </ol>
